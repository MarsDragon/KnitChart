# KnitChart
A way to make small knit charts. That's about it, really.

Enter in how big of a chart you want to make, then click on colors to set them, click on the chart to put them on the chart. Click "Lace" to open the lace stitches, which work the same way as the colors.

This may be updated in the future.
